# AgentSandcastle
Begin your research/engineering journey of building/advancing your own agent framework, begin from this repository as a reference.
AgentSandcastle is an experimental framework designed to run locally on modest hardware (e.g. a MacBook Air) while supporting LLM and multimodal LLM training, inference, and serving. The framework is tailored for researchers and developers who want to prototype and experiment with multi-agent systems under constrained computing resources.

## Overview
AgentSandcastle aims to bridge the gap between cutting-edge agent research and practical, local experimentation. It provides a lightweight, end-to-end environment that minimizes external dependencies and offers a controllable, modular system for deploying both single and multi-agent architectures.

## Motivation
The inspiration behind AgentSandcastle came from my personal journey in exploring optimization across the full stack of LLM development—spanning training, inference, and serving. While following the trends in agent research, I found that available codebases often had heavy dependencies (e.g. on langchain) and were not designed to run efficiently on low-resource systems. With AgentSandcastle, I wanted to create a platform that:

* Runs on a personal machine such as a MacBook or desktop.
* Provides a system-level approach for rapid prototyping of new methods or hypotheses.
* Supports multi-modal input/output processing in a user-friendly, end-to-end framework.

## Key Features
* Local LLM Engine: Optimized for low-resource hardware while still enabling experimentation with state-of-the-art (multimodal) LLMs.
* Multi-Agent System: Easily extendable framework to simulate and test various agent interactions.
* Minimal Dependencies: Designed to run with minimal external libraries for easier maintenance and greater control.
* Modular Architecture: Components are designed to be plug-and-play, allowing researchers to integrate new optimization techniques seamlessly.
* End-to-End Usability: Aiming to deliver a smooth experience from prototype to production-level experiments.

## Usage
Instructions on setting up and running AgentSandcastle on your local machine:
* Installation: Detailed steps on how to install the required packages and set up the environment.
* Configuration: Guidelines on how to configure the framework for your specific use case.
* Running the Framework: Example commands and sample scripts to get you started with training and deploying your LLMs and multi-agent systems.
* Customization: Directions on how to integrate your own optimization techniques and extend the framework’s capabilities.

## Roadmap
* Proof of Concept: Launch the initial PoC with minimal optimization considerations.
* Optimization Iterations: Gradually integrate and test various ML/MLOps optimization techniques.
* Community Contributions: Encourage community-driven enhancements and experiments to further refine the framework.
* Extensive Documentation: Build comprehensive documentation and tutorials to assist users in deploying end-to-end agent systems.

## Contributing
Contributions are welcome! If you have ideas or improvements related to system optimization, multi-agent orchestration, or any other aspect, please feel free to open an issue or pull request. Our goal is to evolve AgentSandcastle into a robust platform that benefits the research community.
